    dialogue:
    - Admiral, you need to make a choice that no one ever should. I'm so sorry this
      must fall on you.
    - You can either take the Mag Stabilzer, and restore Old Earth, but leave New
      Terra's defenses weakend.
    - Or focus on our own people, defend New Terra, but leave those left behind on
      Old Earth to die.
    - Which will it be?
